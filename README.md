# XamarinFormsSMS

This is a simple Xamarin example using Visual Studio Community 2015  for study purpose. 
The main goal is using the SMS native feature of Android, IOS and Windows Phone 8.1.

It is based on an example from <b>Xamarin.Forms Succinctly</b> book (by Derek Jensen - Syncfusion Inc.). This book is available for free download from www.syncfusion.com on completion of a registration form.


Notes:
- The Book uses <b>SmsComposeTask</b> class from <b>Microsoft.Phone.Tasks</b> namespace that was discontinued in Windows Phone 8.1. This example uses the new substitute <b>Windows.ApplicationModel.Chat.ChatMessage</b> class.
- This example has tested on the Android and Windows Phone 8.1 devices. I was not able to test it on IOS.
